# SecuriCash 🔐

💰 Initially, banks were considered the economic middle channel only to lend money and
accept deposits from the population. But, with the implementation of privatisation and
globalisation policy, the banking sector has been rapidly adopting advanced technolo-
gies. Maintaining millions of transactions daily involves a great deal of data. This
data needs to be accessible to all branches around the clock. Cloud Computing is the
most convenient way to provide on-demand access to a shared pool of computational re-
sources over the network. And therefore, Banks are moving towards Cloud Computing.

☁️ The major drawback is that since the resources are available over the network, there
is a high probability of bad actors exploiting vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure.
This project deals with methods for the banks to identify security misconfigurations in
the cloud infrastructure and prevent any attacks.

## Setting Up the Project 🔧

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/savi-1311/bank-security
   ```
2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a .env file using the template .env.template and add values accordingly.
   
### Usage

1.  Switch to the Backend folder and run the backend server

    ```sh 
    npm start 
    ```
    
2.  Switch to the Frontend folder and run the frontend server

    ```sh 
    npm start 
    ```
    
    Make sure you start the Backend server before the Frontend server to avoid unnecessary errors.
